**GeoDistributedLRUCache: Simplifying Latency Optimization**

At Ormuco, latency is a significant challenge in daily operations. To address this issue, I've developed the `GeoDistributedLRUCache` library, which is purpose-built to optimize latency and improve the performance of our distributed systems.

**1. Simplicity - Integration Needs to Be Dead Simple:**

The `GeoDistributedLRUCache` is designed with simplicity in mind. Integration is as straightforward as importing the library, creating a cache instance, and using it within your services. It abstracts away the complexities of distributed caching, allowing for seamless integration.

```python
from geodistributedlrucache import GeoDistributedLRUCache

# Create a cache instance
cache = GeoDistributedLRUCache("example_cache:", 3600, ["redis1.example.com", "redis2.example.com"])

# Store a value in the cache
cache.set("user:123", "JohnDoe")

# Retrieve a value from the cache
result = cache.get("user:123")
```

**2. Resilient to Network Failures or Crashes:**

Our systems face network failures from time to time. The `GeoDistributedLRUCache` is prepared for these situations. It connects to multiple Redis servers, ensuring that even in the event of a network failure, our cache remains operational. Rigorous testing, including simulated network failures, confirms its resilience.

**3. Near Real-Time Replication of Data Across Geolocation:**

For low-latency access and data consistency, the cache employs near real-time data replication across our geolocations. When data is stored in the cache, it is promptly synchronized across all relevant regions. Thorough testing validates this synchronization.

**4. Data Consistency Across Regions:**

Data consistency across regions is a non-negotiable requirement for our distributed systems. The `GeoDistributedLRUCache` guarantees that updates made in one region are consistently accessible from another. This is validated through extensive testing.

**5. Locality of Reference:**

Minimizing latency is a priority, and we achieve this by optimizing the locality of reference. Frequently accessed data is readily available in the local region, reducing response times for our services.

**6. Flexible Schema:**

Our systems deal with diverse data types. The `GeoDistributedLRUCache` embraces this diversity with a flexible schema, accommodating not only strings but also integers, lists, and various other data types. This adaptability ensures our cache meets the varying data requirements of our services.

```python
# Storing data with different data types
cache.set("int_key", 42)
cache.set("str_key", "Hello, World!")
cache.set("list_key", [1, 2, 3])
```

**7. Cache Can Expire:**

To prevent stale data from affecting our services, the cache allows entries to expire after a specified time (TTL). Our tests demonstrate that cached items are indeed evicted after their TTL has elapsed, ensuring data freshness.

```python
# Cache entry expires after 2 seconds
cache = GeoDistributedLRUCache("example_cache:", 2, ["redis1.example.com"])
cache.set("user:123", "JohnDoe")
time.sleep(3)  # TTL expires
result = cache.get("user:123")
assert result is None  # The entry is no longer available
```
